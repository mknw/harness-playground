# Two roles, selected by the first argument:
#
#   (no args)            ENTRYPOINT mode. Prepare /work and block forever so the
#                        container is a long-lived idle host. The harness then
#                        spawns MCP servers on demand via:
#                            docker exec <ctr> /opt/mcp/init.sh serve <name>
#
#   serve filesystem     Run rust-mcp-filesystem on stdio, scoped to /work,
#                        write enabled. Used as the docker-exec target by
#                        DockerBackend.connectMcp.
#
#   serve shell          Run mcp-shell on stdio. Same purpose.
#
# Keeping both behind one script means connectMcp targets a single, stable
# launch path per server (see docs/sandbox-plan.md → "How tools reach the
# controller" / the DockerBackend exec model).
