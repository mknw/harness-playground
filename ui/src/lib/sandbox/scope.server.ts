/**
 * Request-scoped sandbox context — AsyncLocalStorage.
 *
 * `withSandbox` acquires a sandbox (boot + connectMcp) and runs the wrapped
 * pattern inside an ALS scope carrying the resulting `McpTransport`. Three
 * downstream readers consult it (see docs/sandbox-plan.md → "How tools reach
 * the controller"):
 *
 *   1. `mcp-client.callTool` — routes sandbox-owned tool names to the in-VM
 *      transport instead of the host gateway.
 *   2. `simpleLoop` / `actorCritic` — extend their allowlist guard with
 *      `sandbox.ownsTool(...)` so sandbox tools pass `tools.includes(...)`
 *      without being threaded through the pattern's `tools` / `availableTools`.
 *   3. BAML adapters in `baml-adapters.server.ts` — append the active
 *      sandbox's `listTools()` descriptions to the prompt's tool list so the
 *      actor sees them in its first-turn prompt.
 *
 * Model: same shape as `settings-context.server.ts`. Sentinel is `undefined`
 * (sandbox is opt-in — outside a wrapper, readers behave exactly as today).
