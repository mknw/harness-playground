/**
 * Sandbox Session Agent (persistent)
 *
 * The sandbox is **session-persistent**: `withSandbox({ id: sessionId })` keys
 * the VM to the conversation via the shared AttachmentTable, so every turn
 * reuses the same container with its /work files, installed packages, and env
 * intact — and it's the *same* container the interactive Shell terminal
 * attaches to (the PTY manager keys on sessionId too). Write a file with the
 * agent, then `cat` it in the Terminal tab's Shell; both see one workspace.
 *
 * Contrast with an *ephemeral* sandbox (a fresh, reset VM per turn): pick this
 * agent when follow-ups should build on prior state.

const SANDBOX_SESSION_GUIDANCE = `
You have a PERSISTENT Linux sandbox for this conversation, shared with the
user's interactive terminal. Within a session, files under /work persist across
turns. Across sessions, only the durable folders below survive.

Workspace layout:
- /work/in  — uploads and files you saved in earlier sessions are RESTORED here
              at the start of each session. Look here for the user's inputs.
- /work/out — write any file the user should KEEP (a report, an updated
              spreadsheet, generated data) here. Files in /work/out are saved to
              the Data Stash and restored into /work/in next time.
- /work     — anything else is scratch; it is cleared when the sandbox recycles.

Available tools (all run inside the sandbox VM):
- sandbox_bash: run a shell command. Python 3 is available.
- sandbox_write / sandbox_read / sandbox_edit: manage files under /work.
- sandbox_list / sandbox_search: inspect the working directory.

Guidance:
1. Build incrementally — check /work/in and /work for files from earlier turns
   before recreating anything.
2. For anything computational, run code in the sandbox rather than guessing.
3. When a task produces a FILE the user should keep, write it to /work/out
   (don't just compute the answer with a throwaway python3 -c). That file is the
   deliverable and is what persists to the Data Stash.
4. Let the critic decide completion — you don't need a Return tool. Focus on
   producing the right tool call; the critic ends the loop when the result is
   sufficient.
