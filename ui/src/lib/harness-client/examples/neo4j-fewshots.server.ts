/**
 * Few-shot examples for the Neo4j route in the default agent.
 *
 * Five canonical examples derived from live MCP queries against the local
 * graph (Concept nodes connected via DEFINES / HAS_CONCEPT / HAS_FIELD / etc.).
 * Each example was verified against `read_neo4j_cypher` / `write_neo4j_cypher`
 * before being captured here, so the args are guaranteed to be valid Cypher
 * the controller can crib from.
 *
 * Categories covered:
 *  1. read · find-by-name             (simple MATCH on a property)
 *  2. read · case-insensitive search  (CONTAINS + toLower for substring match)
 *  3. read · degree aggregation       (count(r), ORDER BY DESC, LIMIT)
 *  4. write · create-and-connect      (MATCH parent, MERGE child, MERGE rel)
 *  5. write · bulk UNWIND upsert      (parameterized batch with ON CREATE / ON MATCH)
