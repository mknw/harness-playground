/**
 * Flavoured Sandbox Agent (router over sandbox flavours)
 *
 * Demonstrates the composable recipe from docs/sandbox-flavours.md: a `router`
 * that dispatches each turn to a differently-*flavoured* `withSandbox` route.
 * Flavour selection lives entirely in the harness — the routed controller is
 * flavour-agnostic.
 *
 * Routes:
 *   - basic            → EPHEMERAL `base` box (anonymous pool: a reset,
 *                        fresh-state VM each turn). Quick shell / general work.
 *   - image_processing → PERSISTENT `image-processing` box (Pillow, OpenCV,
 *                        imagemagick).
 *   - data             → PERSISTENT `data` box (pandas/numpy/polars/pyarrow,
 *                        matplotlib/seaborn, excel backends, reportlab/pypdf).
 *   - office           → PERSISTENT `office` box (python-docx, openpyxl +
 *                        xlsxwriter, PyMuPDF) for editing docx/xlsx/pdf files.
 *
 * The two persistent routes use a **flavour-scoped attachment id**
 * (`${sessionId}:${rootfs}`) so they get separate containers, while `sessionId`
 * (the Data Stash key) is shared — so /work hydrate/promote is common across
 * flavours, only in-VM scratch differs. This shows multiple persistent flavours
 * in one session working today, without the deferred flavour-in-identity change.
 *
 * NOTE: the interactive Shell terminal attaches to the base `sessionId`
 * container (PtyManager keys on sessionId, rootfs 'base'), NOT these flavoured
 * ones — flavour-aware Shell is deferred (#116). See docs/sandbox-flavours.md.
