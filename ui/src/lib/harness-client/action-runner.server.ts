/**
 * POST-triggered Action Runner — Server Only
 *
 * In-process fire-and-forget execution for the `POST /api/agents/:id` endpoint.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a `"use server"` module: every export of a `"use server"`
 * file becomes a client-callable RPC endpoint, and these functions take a
 * `userId` parameter (the route resolves it from the Bearer secret). Exposing
 * them as RPCs would let a client run an agent as any user. Keeping them here —
 * imported only by the route — means they're plain server-side functions.
 *
 * Flow (see `routes/api/agents/[id].ts`):
 *   1. Route authenticates + parses multipart, stores the recording in the
 *      Data Stash, then calls `seedActionRow` to insert the observable row.
 *   2. Route calls `runAgentInBackground` WITHOUT awaiting and returns 202.
 *   3. This module runs the harness to completion and persists the result.

 *
 * Always a fresh first run — it never `continueSession`s the seeded
 * placeholder (which would duplicate the user_message). Wrapped in
 * `runWithUserId` so pattern closures resolve the owner; settings fall back to
 * `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` (no request-scoped settings off the request path). The
 * harness itself never throws (it catches internally and returns an `error`
